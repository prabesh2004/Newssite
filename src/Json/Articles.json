        "description": "A thick crust of black ash has settled on the pavements and roads in the centre of Jenin.\n\nIt comes from barricades of burning tyres set up by young Palestinian men, who prowl streets where they might see an Israeli jeep. Some of them carry rocks or small home-made bombs to hurl at passing Israeli vehicles. In sporadic bursts, gunfire and explosions echo in the refugee camp, which is on high ground above the town centre. Israeli drones buzz constantly overhead.",

In a coffin of oak, beneath the red and yellow royal standard of Scotland, lay Queen Elizabeth. Around her stood clerics in scarlet, archers in green, and police officers wearing pristine white gloves.
